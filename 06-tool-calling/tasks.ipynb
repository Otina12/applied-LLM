        "# 🧪 Lab Task: The \"Smart Search\" Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task is to build a conversational agent that answers user questions using a single, powerful `web_search` tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool is \"smart\": your Python implementation of the function must internally and invisibly call a (mock or real) small LLM to rewrite the query before it ever calls the final search API. The main LLM will be unaware this \"rewrite\" step is happening.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Standard Task\n",
        "\n",
        "### Define the Single Function Tool:\n",
        "\n",
        "From the LLM's perspective, it only knows about one tool: `web_search(user_query: str) -> List[SearchResult]`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `user_query` will be the user's raw, conversational text (e.g., \"Why is the sky blue?\").\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implement the \"Smart\" Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "Your Python code that defines `web_search` must execute this internal sequence:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1 (Internal):** Take the `user_query` string.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2 (Internal):** Pass this string to a smaller LLM API (or just a hard-coded prompt) with instructions like, \"You are a search query expert. Convert this question into 3-5 optimal keywords.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3 (Internal):** Receive the `rewritten_query` (e.g., \"Rayleigh scattering atmosphere\") from that internal call.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4 (Internal):** Use this `rewritten_query` to call the actual search API (e.g., Google, Bing, or a mock JSON file).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 5 (Return):** Return the final list of `SearchResult` objects to the main LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implement the Agent Logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The LLM's main prompt should instruct it to use the `web_search` tool whenever it needs external information.\n",
        "- The LLM will call the tool with the user's messy query.\n",
        "- It will receive the clean search results back (unaware of the internal rewrite).\n",
        "- It must then use these results to synthesize a final, helpful answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Flow:\n",
        "\n",
        "**User:** \"What's the best way to get from Warsaw to Berlin?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLM (call 1):** `web_search(user_query=\"What's the best way to get from Warsaw to Berlin?\")`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Code (Internal Step 1-3):** Calls rewriter → gets back \"Warsaw to Berlin travel options train bus flight\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Code (Internal Step 4):** Calls search API with the new query → gets back `[{title: \"Trains Warsaw-Berlin...\", snippet: \"...\", url: \"...\"}, ...]`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Code (returns to LLM):** `[{title: \"Trains Warsaw-Berlin...\", snippet: \"...\", url: \"...\"}, ...]`\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLM (final answer):** \"You can travel from Warsaw to Berlin by train, bus, or plane. According to 'Trains Warsaw-Berlin...', the train takes about 6 hours...\"\n",

        "## 🚀 Advanced Task\n",
        "\n",
        "### Add a Second Tool for Summarization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, add a new, separate tool that the LLM is aware of: `scrape_and_summarize(urls: List[str]) -> str`\n",
        "\n",
        "This function (which you'll implement) takes a list of URLs and returns a block of (mocked or real) text summarizing their content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Modify the Agent Logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Update the LLM's main prompt. Instruct it to first call `web_search` as before.\n",
        "- Then, it must analyze the search snippets.\n",
        "- If the snippets are too short or don't fully answer the question, it should make a second, follow-up call to `scrape_and_summarize` using the top 2-3 URLs from the first call.\n",
        "- This tests the LLM's ability to chain tools and make decisions based on intermediate results."

            "The main reason the stock market was down in November 2025 is because of major policy changes, especially new tariffs introduced by U.S. President Donald Trump in April 2025. These tariffs affected nearly all sectors of the U.S. economy and led to intensified trade wars with China, Canada, and Mexico. The sudden and sweeping nature of these tariffs caused panic selling and sharp declines in global stock markets, especially in technology and AI-focused stocks, which were seen as overpriced and vulnerable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other contributing factors included:\n",
            "- Concerns about overpriced tech stocks (like Nvidia, Apple, and Tesla) that had been leading the market.\n",
            "- Ongoing volatility and uncertainty from aggressive U.S. trade actions.\n",
            "- Decreased consumer confidence and spending, as seen in surveys.\n",
            "- Risk of a possible recession due to higher business costs and disrupted supply chains.\n",
            "\n",
            "By mid-2025, markets had partly recovered after some tariff pauses, but there was still a lot of caution. The market remained narrowly focused on a few large tech companies, making it sensitive to any new shocks. Overall, the drop in November 2025 was driven by a mix of trade policy uncertainty, high market valuations, and worries about economic growth.\n"
