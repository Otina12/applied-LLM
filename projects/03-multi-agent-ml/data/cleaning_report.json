  "summary": "Data quality cleaning actions:\n1. Imputed 177 missing values in 'Age' using mean strategy based on its distribution and correlation with other features.\n2. Dropped column 'Cabin' due to 77% missing values and high cardinality which would not contribute meaningfully to modeling.\n3. Imputed 2 missing values in 'Embarked' using mode strategy, since it had very few missing values and is a categorical feature.\n4. Converted 'Pclass', 'Sex', and 'Embarked' columns to category dtype to optimize memory usage and processing speed.",
